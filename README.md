# COVID-19 / Pneumonia / Normal Prediction using Deep Learning.

Predicting Noval Corona, Pneumonia, Healthy from X-ray scans using Keras and Scikit Learn.
Right now the world is in the fear of Noval Coronavirus (COVID-19). By this time, there are approximately 3.12 Million. The COVID-19  virus spreads by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person. This could happen either by direct close contact with an infected person or by indirect contact like the droplets on surfaces and clothes.

Predicting COVID-19 using X-ray images.
In this tutorial, I am using X-ray images to analyze the health of the patientâ€™s lungs since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells (cells that come from surfaces of the respiratory tract) and X-ray scans are easy to get than CT scans. <br>

Go ahead and download the training and testing dataset from the link given [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wwXhV2pNJjGdC4dsMz3NQxfhojthUbeB).

## Conclusion : 
To this end, I am making my code, model, and results available here [Code](https://jovian.ml/v-snehith999/corona-pneumonia-normal-keras).
https://jovian.ml/v-snehith999<br>
* I am updating my dataset and model, as more data gets publicly accessible. I am looking for a better method to evaluate the entire test set. <br>
* I discovered that my model loss is spiking at the end of training and I am looking for a possible solution.
NOTE: If anybody got better metrics than me, please do share your knowledge after all Knowledge is Sharing!!
