# COVID-19 / Pneumonia / Normal Prediction using Deep Learning.

Predicting Noval Corona, Pneumonia, Healthy from X-ray scans using Keras and Scikit Learn.
Right now the world is in the fear of Noval Coronavirus (COVID-19). By this time, there are approximately 3.12 Million. The COVID-19  virus spreads by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person. This could happen either by direct close contact with an infected person or by indirect contact like the droplets on surfaces and clothes.

Predicting COVID-19 using X-ray images.
In this tutorial, I am using X-ray images to analyze the health of the patientâ€™s lungs since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells (cells that come from surfaces of the respiratory tract) and X-ray scans are easy to get than CT scans.
